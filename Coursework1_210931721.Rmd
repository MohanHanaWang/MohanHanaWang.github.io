## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


install.packages("prophet")
library(prophet)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
df=read_excel('Data.xlsx',sheet="Data")
install.packages("tseries")
library(tseries)
ds=ts(df$ds,start = c(2010,2),frequency = 12)
y<-ts(df$y,start = c(2010,2),frequency = 12)
df=data.frame(ds,y)
library(prophet)
m=prophet(df)
#In addition to the date of historical data, it is extrapolated by 12 months
future=make_future_dataframe(m,periods=12)
#Prediction datasets
forecast=predict(m,future)  
install.packages("farver")
library(farver)
plot(m,forecast)



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
